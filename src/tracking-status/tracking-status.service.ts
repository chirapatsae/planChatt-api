  /**
   * W105-BE-PR1 — Owner-scoped bulk Ready → Pending transition for
   * MAIN-PLAN ProjectGroup rows.
   *
   * Replaces the N-parallel `POST /tracking-status/` storm produced by
   * `ReadyToSendPage.handleChangeStatusSelect` with a single round-trip
   * that performs per-project validation, partial-success semantics, and
   * collects post-commit notification descriptors (`bulkEmits[]`) for the
   * BE-PR2 digest dispatcher.
   *
   * Validation order per CLAUDE.md VALIDATION ORDER:
   *
   *   GLOBAL (run once before the per-project loop; failure rejects the
   *   ENTIRE request — not a per-row error):
   *     1. Authenticated user resolves
   *     2. Current/latest WorkHistory exists
   *     3. workStatus = approved
   *     4. Resolve submitter classification (agency vs lao) per CLAUDE.md §1
   *
   *   PER-PROJECT (each project runs in its own sub-transaction so a
   *   failure in one DOES NOT roll back successful peers — partial-success):
   *     5.  Load ProjectGroup
   *     6.  Same-org scope (§4.2) — Ready → Pending allows same-org
   *         submission. LAO requester must match project LAO; agency
   *         requester must match agency scope. Owner is always allowed.
   *     7.  Plan scope binding (§10): isLatest, !isBooked, matching open
   *         PlanPhase
   *     8.  Workflow scope: must be a main-plan project (RPG → WRONG_WORKFLOW)
   *         — implicit because we look up via `projectGroupRepo`.
   *     9.  Current latest status === 'Ready'
   *     10. Lineage lock (§14)
   *     11. Insert new TrackingStatus row, flip prior latest
   *     12. Push BulkSubmitEmit
   *
   * Transaction strategy: PER-PROJECT SUB-TRANSACTION (Option B per task
   * §6.3). Each project runs inside its own `dataSource.transaction()`
   * callback so a thrown exception inside one rolls back ONLY that
   * project's work. Rationale: simpler error isolation than savepoint
   * juggling, matches the partial-success contract verbatim, and the
   * per-project tx overhead is acceptable at the array cap of 100 rows.
   *
   * §17.3 — `bulkEmits[]` is in-memory only. The notification dispatch
   * happens AFTER all per-project transactions resolve and is wrapped in
   * try/catch per emit so a notification failure cannot fail the request.
   *
   * §12 — every successful project produces ONE TrackingStatus row with
   * isLatest flip; the digest does NOT touch tracking_status.
