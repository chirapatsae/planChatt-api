  /**
   * W105-BE-PR1 — Owner-scoped bulk Ready → Pending transition for
   * MAIN-PLAN ProjectGroup rows.
   *
   * Replaces the N-parallel `POST /tracking-status/` storm produced by
   * `ReadyToSendPage.handleChangeStatusSelect` with a single round-trip
   * that performs per-project validation, partial-success semantics, and
   * collects post-commit notification descriptors (`bulkEmits[]`) for the
   * BE-PR2 digest dispatcher.
   *
   * Validation order per CLAUDE.md VALIDATION ORDER:
   *
   *   GLOBAL (run once before the per-project loop; failure rejects the
   *   ENTIRE request — not a per-row error):
   *     1. Authenticated user resolves
   *     2. Current/latest WorkHistory exists
   *     3. workStatus = approved
   *     4. Resolve submitter classification (agency vs lao) per CLAUDE.md §1
   *
   *   PER-PROJECT (each project runs in its own sub-transaction so a
   *   failure in one DOES NOT roll back successful peers — partial-success):
   *     5.  Load ProjectGroup
   *     6.  Same-org scope (§4.2) — Ready → Pending allows same-org
   *         submission. LAO requester must match project LAO; agency
   *         requester must match agency scope. Owner is always allowed.
   *     7.  Plan scope binding (§10): isLatest, !isBooked, matching open
   *         PlanPhase
   *     8.  Workflow scope: must be a main-plan project (RPG → WRONG_WORKFLOW)
   *         — implicit because we look up via `projectGroupRepo`.
   *     9.  Current latest status === 'Ready'
   *     10. Lineage lock (§14)
   *     11. Insert new TrackingStatus row, flip prior latest
   *     12. Push BulkSubmitEmit
   *
   * Transaction strategy: PER-PROJECT SUB-TRANSACTION (Option B per task
   * §6.3). Each project runs inside its own `dataSource.transaction()`
   * callback so a thrown exception inside one rolls back ONLY that
   * project's work. Rationale: simpler error isolation than savepoint
   * juggling, matches the partial-success contract verbatim, and the
   * per-project tx overhead is acceptable at the array cap of 100 rows.
   *
   * §17.3 — `bulkEmits[]` is in-memory only. The notification dispatch
   * happens AFTER all per-project transactions resolve and is wrapped in
   * try/catch per emit so a notification failure cannot fail the request.
   *
   * §12 — every successful project produces ONE TrackingStatus row with
   * isLatest flip; the digest does NOT touch tracking_status.

  /**
   * SUPP_STAFF_BE_02 — Atomic bulk staff transition for SupplementProjectGroup.
   *
   * Sibling of `createManyRevisedProjectGroup`. Mirrors that method
   * byte-for-byte and substitutes the SPG-specific scope (parent plan +
   * DevelopmentPlanSupplement) and the agency-based staff responsibility
   * gate (Q3 — `WorkHistoryGovernmentAgencyResponsibility`) borrowed from
   * the single-row `createBySupplementProjectGroup`.
   *
   * Per-row guards reuse the staff branch of `createBySupplementProjectGroup`:
   *   - SPG exists and is not soft-deleted (load with relations)
   *   - Parent DevelopmentPlan.isLatest (DevelopmentPlan.isBooked is NOT a
   *     gate per supplement workflow §6 — parent plan being booked is the
   *     EXPECTED state for the supplement workflow)
   *   - DevelopmentPlanSupplement.isLatest, !isBooked (§15 book-lock
   *     equivalent — a non-latest or booked supplement is the §15 LOCKED
   *     case)
   *   - For staff role: agency responsibility via
   *     `WorkHistoryGovernmentAgencyResponsibility` — admin / super-admin
   *     bypass
   *   - Strict staff transition map (CLAUDE.md §3):
   *       Pending → Verified
   *       Verified → Pending_Approval
   *       Pending_Approval → Approved
   *     (Returned_For_Revision is INTENTIONALLY excluded from the bulk
   *     path — mirrors the RPG bulk sibling; staff-led
   *     Returned_For_Revision remains single-row via
   *     `create-by-supplement-project-group`.)
   *
   * Atomic transaction — any per-row failure throws and rolls back the
   * entire batch (no per-row "skip on failure" mode). Cap = 200 rows
   * (§19.6 mirror).
   *
   * §17.4 baseline snapshot is NOT fired — staff bulk transitions are NOT
   * authoring surfaces (Wave 11 clarification). The owner-driven SPG
   * Ready → Pending baseline path lives in `createBySupplementProjectGroup`
   * and is unaffected by this method.
   *
   * §18 cascade is NOT triggered — cascade only fires on book cancel /
   * finalize (per §18.2 trigger surfaces), never on individual project
   * transitions. The book mutations remain owned by their existing
   * services.
   *
   * Post-commit notifications mirror the RPG bulk sibling: per-item
   * dispatch via `dispatchPhaseOneNotification` with
   * `projectKind: 'supplement-project-group'`. A notification failure
   * logs but does NOT roll back (§4.1, §17.2).

  /**
   * SUPP_AI_BE_05 (2026-05-15) — fire a §17.4 `no-ai-baseline` snapshot
   * for the SPG transitioning to `Pending` from the owner court.
   *
   * Originally implemented in SUPP-IA-03 (BE-β, 2026-05-12) as a
   * post-commit advisory call. Per the SUPP_AI_BE_05 task spec §7 and
   * `workflow-add-project-supplement.md` §15 trigger-policy contract,
   * this call is now invoked from INSIDE the workflow transaction (as
   * the final step before the transaction returns). Any failure thrown
   * from this method propagates to the outer transaction and rolls
   * back the SPG status flip atomically.
   *
   * Why an `EntityManager` parameter:
   *   - SPG + budgets MUST be read through the caller's manager so the
   *     read sees in-flight tx state (the SPG row is committed in a
   *     prior transaction at `[create POST]`, but we still prefer the
   *     manager-bound repo for consistency with the caller's tx).
   *   - `BookFormatResolver.resolveBySupplementProjectGroup` already
   *     accepts an EntityManager; we forward the caller's manager.
   *   - `PreSubmitSnapshotService.createSnapshot` opens its OWN
   *     transaction internally (per BE_03 contract — we MUST NOT
   *     modify it). When called from inside an outer tx with a
   *     separate connection, its write commits independently; a
   *     throw still propagates to the outer tx and triggers rollback
   *     of the workflow-side state changes, which is the atomicity
   *     guarantee the task spec asks for. Idempotency by
   *     `(target_kind, target_id, content_hash)` per Wave 10 makes
   *     any leaked-row scenario harmless on retry.
   *
   * Contract:
   *   - `endpoint='no-ai-baseline'`, `staleness_policy='snapshot-only'`
   *   - `target_kind='supplement-project-group'`, `target_id=spg.id`
   *   - `workflow='add'`
   *   - `submittedByWorkHistoryId` resolved server-side by
   *     `PreSubmitSnapshotService` against the caller's WorkHistory
   *   - `content_hash` computed by `PreSubmitSnapshotService` via the
   *     SHARED `computeSmartApproveContentHash` helper using the
   *     exact `{ project, classification, attachments, justification }`
   *     shape that BE_03 consumes. Hash determinism across surfaces
   *     is preserved per Wave 10.
   *
   * §17.2 advisory-only semantics — the baseline row never gates a
   * workflow decision (the snapshot service does not block the
   * transition; what blocks the transition is a thrown exception from
   * the snapshot WRITE itself, which is a separate concern from "is
   * the score advisory"). §17.4 forces `isStale: false` on the read
   * side for `snapshot-only` rows.
   *
   * §17.3 audit separation — the snapshot row has no FK to SPG.

   * SUPP-1 / BE-02 + Wave SUPP-4 — Staff-led rollback for SupplementProjectGroup.
   *
   * Mirrors `rollbackRevisionProjectGroupStatus` with two differences:
   *   1. Scope is the SPG's supplement chain (parent DevelopmentPlan +
   *      DevelopmentPlanSupplement), not a DevelopmentPlanRevision.
   *   2. Responsibility check is AGENCY-BASED (Q3, mirror of RPG).
   *
   * §14 descendant guard — Wave SUPP-4. Now that
   * `revised_project_groups.prev_project_type` includes `'supplement'`,
   * an SPG may have live RPG descendants. The §14.8 guard rejects rollback
   * with `409 PROJECT_HAS_DESCENDANT` whenever such a descendant exists,
   * matching the RPG rollback semantics. There is NO hard-delete of the
   * SPG row itself: SPG is the ROOT of its own lineage (no upstream
   * parent to unlock), so the §14.6 ghost-descendant fix does not apply.
   * Natural rollback semantics (hard-delete latest TrackingStatus +
   * restore previous to isLatest=true) are preserved.
   *
   * The `clearResponsibleAgency` flag is inapplicable to SPG because every
   * SPG is agency-origin (§9 of the supplement workflow). We silently
   * ignore it here (chosen branch — see workflow doc §12). A future
   * tightening could throw on `clearResponsibleAgency=true`; the silent
   * ignore preserves backward compatibility with shared client code.

  // ===========================================================================
  // Wave Equipment ผ.03 Phase 2 — BE-04b (2026-05-28).
  // EquipmentProjectGroup (equipment) transition + rollback support.
  //
  // Equipment items are a 4th project kind alongside PG / RPG / SPG and run
  // the full canonical status machine (Ready → Pending → Verified →
  // Pending_Approval → Approved + Pull_Back + Returned_For_Revision +
  // Rejected). Equipment mirrors PG (NOT RPG/SPG) for the responsibility
  // axis because:
  //   - Equipment is main-plan-scoped (parent = DevelopmentPlan, not a
  //     DevelopmentPlanRevision / DevelopmentPlanSupplement).
  //   - Staff responsibility is amphoe-based via
  //     `WorkHistoryAmphoeResponsibility` (Q3 amphoe-mirror, NOT
  //     `WorkHistoryGovernmentAgencyResponsibility`).
  //   - §8 plan activation (`isLatest=true`, `isBooked=false`, matching
  //     open PlanPhase) applies verbatim — agency PlanPhase since
  //     equipment is agency-only by construction (BE-04 enforces).
  //
  // STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES from PG:
  //   1. §14 lineage descendant guard is VACUOUS — equipment has no
  //      `prev_project_id` / `prev_project_type` columns (R3=NO locked
  //      decision). The §14.6 rollback hard-delete of the equipment row
  //      itself is INTENTIONALLY NOT applied; equipment is the root of
  //      its own (currently single-tier) lineage with no upstream parent
  //      to unlock. Natural rollback semantics (hard-delete latest
  //      TrackingStatus + restore previous to isLatest=true) are
  //      preserved. Phase 3 may add lineage additively.
  //   2. `clearResponsibleAgency` is inapplicable — equipment is
  //      agency-only by construction (BE-04 enforces at create via
  //      Layer-1 `AgencyOnlyGuard` + Layer-2 service check), so
  //      §7.2/§7.3 LAO-origin clearing is unreachable. The flag is
  //      silently ignored to preserve backward compatibility with
  //      shared client code (mirrors the SPG ignore at line 3351).
  //   3. Notification dispatch uses `projectKind: 'project-group'`
  //      (PG kind) for now — extending the `projectKind` union to
  //      include `'equipment-project-group'` requires widening 7
  //      notification files (sub-blocker flagged in the BE-04b report).
  //      Equipment notifications therefore reuse the PG email/LINE
  //      templates + deep links (`/agency/admin/pending`,
  //      `/project/edit/:id`, `/project`) — semantically equivalent for
  //      Phase 2 since equipment items live in the same staff queues.

  /**
   * Wave Equipment ผ.03 Phase 2 — BE-04b (2026-05-28).
   * Staff-led rollback for EquipmentProjectGroup.
   *
   * Mirrors `rollbackStatus` (PG) — amphoe-based responsibility, plan
   * scope binding — with TWO deletions:
   *   1. §14 descendant guard is VACUOUS — equipment has no
   *      `prev_project_id` (R3=NO locked decision). No call to
   *      `LineageLockService.assertDeletable`.
   *   2. §14.6 ghost-descendant hard-delete of the equipment row is
   *      INTENTIONALLY NOT applied. Equipment is the root of its own
   *      lineage with no upstream parent to unlock. Hard-deleting the
   *      equipment row would gratuitously destroy the item + its
   *      budgets + its full tracking history (cascade FKs) and would
   *      not benefit any §14 unlock. Natural rollback semantics
   *      (hard-delete current latest TrackingStatus + restore previous
   *      to isLatest=true) are preserved.
   *
   * `clearResponsibleAgency` is inapplicable — equipment is agency-only
   * by construction (BE-04 enforces). The flag is silently ignored to
   * preserve backward compatibility with shared client code (matches
   * the SPG pattern at line 3351).

   *
   * CLAUDE.md compliance:
   *   - §4 ownership — filters via `pg.create_by`/`rpg.create_by`/
   *     `spg.create_by`/`eq.create_by` against the caller's current WH id.
   *   - §17.2 advisory — ZERO writes; never gates workflow.
   *   - §18.5 (no new write-side storage) — read-only over EXISTING rows.
   *   - §18.13 (read-side aggregator allowance) — sanctioned surface.
   *   - §18.10 no role exemption — owner-scoped, not admin; the admin
   *     preview tool remains at `/v1/book-cleanup/preview`.
   *
   * The 4 FROZEN reason templates (§18.6):
